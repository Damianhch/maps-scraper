# Proxy Configuration File
# Format: One proxy per line
# Format 1: ip:port (for proxies without authentication)
# Format 2: ip:port:username:password (for authenticated proxies)
#
# Examples:
# 123.45.67.89:8080
# 98.76.54.32:3128:myuser:mypass
#
# Lines starting with # are ignored
#
# Recommended: Use residential proxies from services like:
# - Bright Data (luminati.io)
# - Oxylabs
# - Smartproxy
# - Proxy-Cheap
#
# For heavy scraping (6000+ businesses), you'll need at least 10-20 proxies
# Rotate them every 50 businesses to avoid detection
